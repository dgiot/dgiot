Version 4.17.6
2021-May-19

        * Fix generation of map types when targeting Erlang 17 and 18 (#196)

        * Rework building outside of a git-repo:
          - Add the possibility to manually specify version
            by adding a gpb.vsn file.
          - Add the concept of a version source: git | file
            include this info in the generated code
          - Add a --dest-dir=DIR option to the mk-versioned-archive

Version 4.17.3
2021-Apr-19

        * Fix mk-versioned-archive to also substitute the
          version in the gpb.app.src file.

Version 4.17.2
2021-Apr-19

        * Fix mk-versioned-archive to actually also work
          from a non-git directory tree.

Version 4.17.1
2021-Apr-17

        * Fix compilation with Elixir 1.12.0, by respecting the
          REBAR_BARE_COMPILER_OUTPUT_DIR env var during descriptor
          compilation.  Thanks to Michael Davis. (#204, #205)

        * On decoding, mask ints to 32 or 64 bits. (#206)

        * Rename helpers/export-from-git to mk-versioned-archive
          and make it able to export also from a non-git dir,
          allowing the version to be set using options.
          Keep a symlink from the old name for backwards compatibility.

Version 4.17.0
2021-Apr-11

        * Save all options as well as custom options, and introduce
          versions 3 and 4 of the proto defs format. (#202)
          See the doc/dev-guide/proto-defs-versions.md for more info.

          The following definition elements were added and changed:
            - Enum values have changed from 2-tuples to 3-tuples:
                previously: {Symbol, Value}
                now:        {Symbol, Value, EnumValueOptions}
            - Added: {{enum_options,EnumName}, [<option>, ...]}
            - Added: {{service_options,ServiceName}, [<option>, ...]}
            - Rpc (custom) option names now look like any other
              custom option names.
            - Option name elements can now contain tuples
              to indicate parenthesized path components, as indicated
              in the doc/dev-guide/proto-defs-versions.md.

          The above redesign also fixes a crash when there were
          enum option. (#203)

          The default version of the returned format and of the format
          in the generated introspection functions is still 1, for
          backwards compatibility. Use the {proto_defs_version,4} option
          in order to use the added definition elements.

        * Add an option, introspect_get_proto_defs (-introspect-get_proto_defs)
          Normally a get_msg_defs/0 function is generated, but this
          has historically only contained message and enum elements.
          With the introspect_get_proto_defs option, a get_proto_defs/0
          is instead generated, containing the same definitions as returned
          when compiling with the to_proto_defs option.
          NB that the format version of the definitions for get_proto_defs/0,
          as well as those for get_msg_defs/0, is by default 1, but can 
          be changed with the {proto_defs_version,N} option.

Version 4.16.2
2021-Feb-27

        * Rework the import handling to check full paths when checking
          if an proto to import has already been seen. #194
        * In a verifier error, emit the faulty field as a string
          instead of as an atom to avoid hitting the system limit
          of 255 chars during the making of the error re ason. #195
        * Fix spec for empty messages to work with dialyzer -Wunderspecs #196
          Also emit -dialyzer({no_underspecs, <fn>/<arity>}) on erl >= 24.
        * Fix the Erlang type of string fields: change to unicode:chardata()
          from iodata() to allow for unicode code points >255. #200
          For clarity, the encoding always worked with such code points,
          it was just the field's type that was wrong.
        * Fix help text when using protoc-erl.
        * A few fixes for Erlang 24 (doc building and in an eunit test)

Version 4.16.1
2021-Jan-19

        * Create Github releases on upload of new tagged versions.
          This is done by a workflow script.
        * Bugfix the export-from-git helper script.
          Except for this fix, this release contains no functional change.

Version 4.16.0
2020-Nov-26

        * Add an option preserve_unknown_fields (-preserve-unknown-fields)
          If set, each message will have one extra field, '$unknowns'
          in which info on any unknown fields are saved during
          decoding, and which will be re-encoded after all other
          field during encoding. (#189)
        * Handle also proto3 syntax for extend Msg { Field; ... } (#190)
        * Bugfix generation of json enum decoders for enums
          not in any message (#192)
        * Set rebar3 as hex build tool. (#191)

Version 4.15.2
2020-Nov-07

        * Fixes for dialyzer issues in generated code,
          mostly when generating for Erlang 17 and 18. (#188)

Version 4.15.1
2020-Nov-01

        * Fixup a workflow syntax error.

Version 4.15.0
2020-Nov-01

        * Add -M family of (makedep) cmd-line options and
          the gpb_compile:[string_]list_io/2,3 functions to
          retreieve dependencies, and outputs from code generation.
        * Fix a link to rebar3. (#187). Thanks to aqian1103 for notifying.
        * Switch to github workflows from travis.

Version 4.14.2
2020-Oct-17

        * Apply renames to the enum type also in export_type. Thanks
          to Jonas Boberg. (#185, #186)
        * Bugfix gpb:msg_to_map/3 for proto3 messages.
        * Fix map associations in type specs and instead indicate
          proto presence in comments.

Version 4.14.1
2020-Sep-05

        * Add a utility gpb:decode_packet/3 mimicing erlang:decode_packet/3,
          but for varint length encoded framing of data.
        * Document the public API in gpb.erl.
        * Document gpb_defs:fetch_imports, it is part of the API.
        * Fix some dialyzer issues in generated code
        * Add back some non-API functions to gpb_parse and gpb_scan
          with the intention of getting exprotobuf going again until
          its issue bitwalker/exprotobuf#114 has been addressed.

Version 4.14.0
2020-Jul-24

        * Introduce a new parser to fix issues with keywords in
          identifier positions. Here are a few examples of .proto that
          the old parser could not handle, but the new one can:

            package a.service.b; // 'service' is also a keyword
            message enum { optional int32 f = 1; } // 'enum'
            message rpc { optional int32 f = 1; } // 'rpc'

          The new parser is a recursive-descent parser that is
          free of such limitations.

          Several parsing shortcomings have also been fixed, such as:
          * Options for oneof, service extensions and groups,
            as well as option blocks: { ... }
          * Allow inf, -inf and nan as default values for float/double
          * Allow "to max" and negative values for reserved
          * Allow reserved names and numbers in enums too
          * Allow, but ignore, public or weak in import

          The intention is that the new parser should accept all files
          that the old parser accepted, and more.  Should there be any
          need to invoke the old parser, eg for comparison or due to bugs,
          it is possible:

          * Set the environment variable GPB_PARSER to old
          * Set the option {parser,old}

          Note that these options will exist only temporarily. The
          intention is to keep the old parser for a few releases,
          and then remove it.

          The functions in gpb_parse and gpb_scan have changed.
          However, they were never part of the external API.
          To retrieve parsed proto definitions use this instead:
          gpb_compile:file(..., [to_proto_defs, ...]).

Version 4.13.0
2020-Jun-30

        * Add support for `optional` fields in proto3 messages.
          This is new in Google's protobuf 3.12.0.  In gpb, this is
          supported out-of-the-box, without any special option option.

          Related to this, the proto defs format has changed and also
          gotten versioned.  The new version is needed to represent
          proto3 messages with optional fields.  By default, when gpb
          returns proto defs, these are returned on the old format,
          for backwards compatibility in gpb-4.x.x.  For more info,
          see to the doc/dev-guide/proto-defs-versions.md file.

Version 4.12.0
2020-Apr-27

        * Add possibility to build on Windows with no Cygwin. Thanks to
          yidayoung. (#182)
        * Add gpb:msg_to_map/3 and gpb:msg_from_map/4.
        * Fix an warning in the generated nif code with protobuf >= 3.7.0.

Version 4.11.2
2020-Apr-09

        * Fix parsing enum option deprecated. Thanks to Paul Swartz for a
        testcase. (#179)

Version 4.11.1
2020-Mar-10

        * Fix a bug in comments generated for 64 bit integer types,
          they were all indicated in the comment as being 32 bits.
        * Fix a bug in the type spec generated for oneof fields,
          when oneof alternatives were translated: they were
          lacking the wrapping tuple, or (for flat oneofs) never included the
          translated type at all.
        * Fix a bug where the decode translator for proto3 scalar fields
          was never called if the field had the default value.

Version 4.11.0
2020-Jan-09

        * Add an option, ignore_wellknown_types_directory, for not
        trying to read and use the priv/proto3/google/protobuf directory
        for wellknowns. Thanks to Nicolas Martyanoff. (#176, #177)

Version 4.10.6
2019-Nov-02

        * Fix a bug for an error return value for missing keys
        when map_key_type = binary

        * Improve description on what proto3 means for optional fields,
        especially for the maps_unset_optional = omitted option.

Version 4.10.5
2019-Oct-25

        * Fix a bug in the generated verifiers for option
        map_key_type = binary: it would report any field
        as extraneous. #174

Version 4.10.4
2019-Oct-05

        * Fix a dialyze issue for map<_,_> type fields
        in generated code (#171).

Version 4.10.3
2019-Oct-03

        * Avoid unnecessary recompilation
        * Fix a eunit test error with Erlang 21.1

Version 4.10.2
2019-Sep-08

        * Fix parsing of custom options for enums.

Version 4.10.1
2019-Aug-16

        * Handle the special JSON mapping of proto3 wellknowns, such as
        google.protobuf.Duration, google.protobuf.Struct, wrapper types etc.
        Only the google.protobuf.Any is not yet handled.

Version 4.10.0
2019-Jul-11

        * New options {gen_mergers,false} (-no-gen-mergers)
        and {gen_introspect,false} (-no-gen-introspect)
        mainly to reduce size of the generated code, especially with nif.
        The first option even requires nif, since merging is an integral
        part of decoding, generally. (#168)

        * Make the rename option available also as a command line
        option. (#168)

        * Make nif code generation handle renamings. (#168)

Version 4.9.3
2019-Jul-10

        * Find and report more errors. Previously these often resulted
        in compilation errors for generated code, but now more errors
        get caught and reported.

Version 4.9.2
2019-Jul-09

        * Add support for the json_name field option
        * Add json support for aliased enums (option allow_alias=true)
        * A few bugfixes and refactorizations

Version 4.9.1
2019-Jul-09

        * Fix bug in nif generation for imports with different
        packages. (#168)

Version 4.9.0
2019-Jul-02

        * Add JSON support via the json options (#164)
        * Add option to prefix/suffix type names  (#165)
        * Minor fixes and updates

Version 4.8.0
2019-Jun-06

        * Drop support for Erlang 17 and earlier, now that Erlang 22 is
        out and rebar3 has dropped support for the same versions.  At
        the moment, things still work, but in the future, the support
        will gradually erode. (#133)

        * Bugfix generation of an unused functions for when strings were
        only occurring in proto3 oneof fields.

        * Bugfix compilation functions return type spec.

Version 4.7.3
2019-May-03

        * Bugfix type specs for strings. Thanks to 柯林呵呵呵. (#166)

Version 4.7.2
2019-Mar-09

        * Wellknown type (google/protobuf/*.proto) can be imported also for
        syntax="proto2", just like how it is for protoc.

        * Misc doc improvements, including addition of developer's guides,
        see doc/dev-guide/*.md

Version 4.7.1
2019-Mar-08

        * Fix descriptor compilation in rebar3 (and rebar2)
        also when gpb is compiled as a dependency.

Version 4.7.0
2019-Mar-08

        * Generate a set of query functions for translating to and from
        fully qualified binaries (fqbin) and internal format, as well as
        functions for locating proto by type definition name. (#163)
        Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.

        * For descriptors, also keep track of what proto file each type
        definition belongs to, by new {file,Info} entries interspersed
        in the definitions. (#163) Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.

        * Bugfix descriptors, ie the self-description info generated when the
        option descriptor (-descr) is specified. (#163)
        Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.

        This introduces a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY, for code that relied
        on details of the old, erroneous, descriptors.

Version 4.6.0
2019-Jan-23

        * Fix error when generating descriptors for protos importing other
        protos, each having package definitions. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter
        for reporting. (#162)

        * Generate a new function, source_basename/0 for retrieving the basename
        of the (main) input source file. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for the
        idea. (#162)

        * Fix error when running edoc after having compiled more than once. The
        gpb_scan.erl got prepended multiple times with a @doc chunk.

Version 4.5.1
2019-Jan-09

        * Fix dialyzer error in generate code when there were no services.
        Thanks to Guilherme Andrade. (#161)

Version 4.5.0
2019-Jan-03

        * Don't edoc generated files by marking them as @private. Thanks to
        Tristan Sloughter. (#159)

        * Generate the functions below. These can convert between fully
        qualified service names (ie with package) and rpc name as binaries, to
        internal names, as atoms, and back. These functions do take into
        consideration options use_packages as well as any renaming options.
        The intended use case is from grpc server or client code.
        - uses_packages()
        - fqbin_to_service_name/1
        - service_name_to_fqbin/1
        - fqbins_to_service_and_rpc_name/2
        - service_and_rpc_name_to_fqbins/2

Version 4.4.1
2018-Dec-03

        * Bugfix decoding: with maps and proto3 unset sub-messages decoded to
        undefined instead of getting omitted. (#158)

        This introduces a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY, for code that relied on
        finding the value undefined, which was arguably somewhat unexpected.

Version 4.4.0
2018-Sep-28

        * New option, bypass_wrappers (-bypass-wrappers). (#153)

        * Fix bash paths for FreeBSD, and incdir variable in Makefile.
        Thanks to Krzysztof Jurewicz. (#155, #156)

        * Drop interim stacktrace macro-overrides GPB_FUNCTION_STACK and
        GPB_PATTERN_STACK, and rely on the ?OTP_RELEASE macro, for
        better direct portability across Erlang pre- and post-21. (#154)

Version 4.3.3
2018-Sep-11

        * Revert the inclusion of the PropEr tests of 4.3.2,
        due to licensing issues. (#152)

Version 4.3.2
2018-Sep-03

        This release brings no new options or fixes, but improves on
        testing of gpb.

        * Add PropEr tests: Use "rebar3 as test proper" to run them.
        This is a conversion of the gpb-eqc tests.  Thanks
        to Pierre Fenoll. (#142, #151)

        * Run with protobuf >= 3.0.0 in Travis. Previously, 2.5.0 was
        used.  Thanks to Pierre Fenoll for bringing this up. (#144)

        * Bugfix nif unit tests with libprotobuf 2.6

Version 4.3.1
2018-Aug-30

        * Fix math.h/cmath and isnan/isinf issue for NIF code.
        Thanks to François Bernier. #150

Version 4.3.0
2018-Aug-29

        * Add options to translate all fields and types: {translate_type,T}
        {translate_field,T} (-translate_type, -translate_field)

        * Add option to have map keys as binaries, for interop with
        other libraries: {maps_key_type,binary} (-maps_key_type binary).
        Thanks to Leonardo Rossi for proposing this functionality. #138

Version 4.2.3
2018-Aug-28

        * Fix a dialyzer issue (a redundant check for undefined) in
        decoding for proto3. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for reporting.

Version 4.2.2
2018-Aug-23

        * For NIFs, also accept enums as integers. Thanks to
        Jean-Alexandre Barszcz. (#147, #148)
        * Fix NIF generation when fields are C++ reserved words, Thanks to
        Jean-Alexandre Barszcz for reporting. (#146)
        * Fix type specs for oneof fields beginning in uppercase.

Version 4.2.1
2018-Jul-13

        * Fix proto3 bug in encoding of default values for enums when
        given as 0 instead of as atom. Thansk to Jean-Alexandre Barszcz
        for reporting.

Version 4.2.0
2018-Jun-27

        * Add an option, translate_type (-translate_type). Previously the
        any_translate option could generate code that called translation
        functions for google.protobuf.Any messages. Translator functions can now
        be called for any types of (sub) message. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter
        for asking the question that prompted this.

        * Add an option {maps_oneof,flat}. For maps, it changes the
        Erlang representaiton of oneof fields from #{..., c => {x,Value}, ...}
        to #{..., x => Value}, ...}

        * Generate type specifications for records, and refer to them. This
        makes it possible to generate types also when there are cyclic
        dependencies. Thanks to Peter Zeller.

Version 4.1.9
2018-Jun-14

        * Bugfix crash when using the renaming options such as
        msg_name_to_lower, when the protobuf files contains package
        definitions, and the use_packages option is not specified. Thanks
        to Mark Geib for reporting. (#139)

Version 4.1.8
2018-May-25

        * Use the OTP_RELEASE macro in generated code, so it can compile
        cleanly with different OTP versions.  The OTP_RELEASE will
        appear in Erlang 21; it has been merged to master, but it is not
        in Erlang 21-rc1, so still honour the GPB_FUNCTION_STACK and
        GPB_PATTERN_STACK macros described for 4.1.6 below.

Version 4.1.7
2018-May-13

        * Fix improper interpretation of nested extend block. If inside
        a message, extending another message, the surrounding message
        was wrongly extended, but this as now been fixed. Thanks to Paul
        Guyot for reporting.

Version 4.1.6
2018-May-08

        * Make the Erlang 21 stacktrace syntax choice overridable.
        In addition to the targetting version described in 4.1.5 below,
        make it possible to override the stacktrace selection:

        When targeting Erlang 21 or later, generate code that uses the new
        stacktrace syntax, but if the user defines 'GPB_FUNCTION_STACK' when
        compiling the generated code, it overrides.

        When targeting Erlang 20 or earlier, generate erlang:get_stacktrace/0
        calls, but if the user defines 'GPB_PATTERN_STACK' when compiling
        the generated code, it overrides.

Version 4.1.5
2018-May-04

        * Prepare for new Erlang 21 stacktrace syntax. If gpb runs on
        the Erlang 21, or if the {target_erlang_version,N} (-for-version N)
        option is set to 21, then gpb generates code that uses the new
        stacktrace syntax, instead of the deprecated erlang:get_stacktrace/0.

Version 4.1.4
2018-May-04

        * Fix type spec for field of types bytes. Thanks to Marc Nijdam.

Version 4.1.3
2018-Feb-08

        * Build changes: Provide better errors when building
        outside of a git repo, and provide a helper script,
        helers/export-from-git, to extract gpb from git in a way such
        that it can be compiled outside fo git.

Version 4.1.2
2018-Jan-26

        * Fix Dialyzer issues in generated code. This regression was
        introduced already in 3.23.0, but only if the type_specs (-type)
        option was specified. That option was on by default in 4.0.0.
        Thanks to GeraldXv for reporting.

Version 4.1.1
2018-Jan-04

        * Bugfix a renaming check: Check for duplicate rpc names only per
        service. The same rpc name can be used in different services, but in
        4.1.0, this was not allowed. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for reporting.

Version 4.1.0
2017-Dec-30

        * Rework renaming options, to make it easier to work with grpc
        where package, service and rpc names are exposed. The new
        options are {rename,{What,How}} where What can specify eg msg_name
        or msg_fqname to operate on only the msg name or the fully
        qualified name, ie prepended with package name. How can be eg
        lowercase or snake_case.

        New renaming possibilities for How are: base_name and
        dots_to_underscores.

        The old msg_name_* options are still handled in backwards
        compatible way.

        Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for the suggestions.

Version 4.0.2
2017-Nov-18

        * Prepare for Erlang 21 by using string functions that are new
        in Erlang 20 and stop using the ones that are going to be
        deprecated in Erlang 21.

Version 4.0.1
2017-Nov-07

        * Fix a build issue.

Version 4.0.0
2017-Nov-07

        * When generating for maps, the  maps_unset_optional = omitted
        is now the default. This is an INCOMPATIBILITY. The previous
        default was present_undefined. This incompatibility is also a
        reason for the stepping to a new major version.

        * Type specs are generated by default when possible.
        The option `{type_specs,false}` (-no_type) can be used if
        this is undesirable for some reason.

        * Automatically append current directory, ".", to the include path.

        * Treat dashes and underscores in command line opts equally

        * Refactor code into separate modules (gpb_compile.erl was far
        too long)

        * Rework decoding by breaking out various parts to separate steps.

Version 3.28.1
2017-Nov-02

        * Similar to the fix in 3.28.0, but for encoding: Warn and
        ignore the option packed for repeated fields that are not
        allowed to be packed, such as string, bytes and sub
        messages. Such fields were not allowed to be be packed i the
        first place, but gpb never said anything so this could go
        unnoticed. And gpb packed them in an invalid fasion, that was
        probably incompaitble with other protobuf parsers/encoders.

        For such fields, this introduces a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY,
        in that the invalid option is now ignored and warned about.

        * Add an option {module_name, Name} (-modname Name) for
        entirely controlling the resulting module name, instead of
        only being able to prefix or suffix it. Thanks to
        Tomas Johansson for the suggestion.

        * Wrap decoding in a {gpb_error, {decoding_failure, ...}}
        if it fails. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for the suggestion.

Version 3.28.0
2017-Oct-14

        * Fix decoding of packed/non-packed repeated. If a repeated
        fields was declared as packed, but an encoder encoded it as
        non-packed (or vice versa), then gpb previously failed to decode
        it.

        This introduces a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: For repeated packed
        fields of type string, bytes and sub messages: such fields were
        actually non-packable but gpb accidentally accepted them.
        Messages with such fields were packed invalidly, and gpb of this
        version will not be able to unpack/decode such stored messages.

        Thanks to Moxley Stratton for reporting.

        * Make the -spec for encode_msg more narrow to avoid some
        dialzer underspec warnings.  Note that all underspecs warnings
        can not in general be avoided.  Thanks to Moxley Stratton and
        Kevin C. Baird for fixing and to Heinz N. Gies for reporting.

Version 3.27.7
2017-Sep-19

        * When verifying maps with maps_unset_optional = omitted,
        signal an error if extraneous fields are present, since they
        might be misspellings of optional fields. Thanks to Guilherme Andrade
        for the suggestion to do this.

Version 3.27.6
2017-Aug-19

        * Add type-defaults to proto3 message records. Thanks to Evan
        Vigil-McClanahan and Tristan Sloughter.

Version 3.27.5
2017-Aug-16

        * Apply tolower or snakecase to rpc names as well. Thanks to Tristan
        Sloughter.

        * Fix an edoc generation bug in gpb_parse.yrl with the edoc opt
        {preprocess,true}.

Version 3.27.4
2017-Aug-07

        Minor small issues

        * Fix crash in encoding of string fields in proto3 messages,
        when the string contained code-points >= 256.

        * Fix wrong type-default in encoding for bytes fields in proto3
        messages, when the bytes was specified as an iolist.

        * Improve typespec for map<_,_> type fields to use := in Erlang 19+

        * Fix dialyzer issues in the generated code

        * Fix decoding of map<_,_> type field items with missing keys
        or values so they decode to type-defaults. Thanks to Tiago
        Guedes for reporting.

Version 3.27.3
2017-Jul-10

        * Repeated fields can now be omitted with maps if option
        maps_unset_optional = omitted. This makes sense especially
        for proto3. Thanks to Adam Cook.

        * Parse custom message and field options. Custom message
        options land in {{msg_options,MsgName},[{Name,Value}] items
        in the output when compiling with to_proto_defs. Thanks
        to Tristan Sloughter for reporting.

        * Improve unit tests to also cover generated hrl files
        One issue fixed: when only mapfields_as_maps (-mapfields_as_maps)
        but not the maps (-maps) option was set.

Version 3.27.2
2017-Jun-18

        * Bugfix code generation for empty groups.

Version 3.27.1
2017-Jun-16

        * Add support for custom options. Thanks to Geoff Hayes.

Version 3.27.0
2017-May-28

        * Add support for groups. Thanks to David Weinstein for prompting
        this to get implementated.

Version 3.26.8
2017-Mar-24

        * Fix name resolution bugs when extending messages in enclosing
        packages and in other packages. Thanks to Michael Ries for reporting.

Version 3.26.7
2017-Mar-15

        * Fix default for map type fields (map<_,_>) when the
        mapfields_as_maps option is set. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter

Version 3.26.6
2016-Dec-29

        * Improve parser to accept keywords such as "message" also as
        message names. This applies to enums, oneof names as well as
        service and rpc names too. Thanks to ionuthristodorescu for
        reporting.

Version 3.26.5
2016-Dec-10

        * Consider also messages also for map fields when calculating
        order of messages, so that type specs for record fields come in
        the right order. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.

Version 3.26.4
2016-Oct-21

        * Add api functions gpb_compile:{locate,read}_import/2 and
        gpb_parse:fetch_imports/1 to facilitate eg proto file dependency
        tracking.

        * Add -types and convert @spec doc tags to proper -specs.

Version 3.26.3
2016-Oct-05

        * Fix dialyzer issue with Erlang 19 in the generated code.  Thanks
        to Sargun Dhillon for reporting. The generated code for merging
        messages unnecessarily/erroneously checked required scalar fields
        for undefined.

Version 3.26.2
2016-Oct-04

        * Integrate with Travis CI. Thanks to Luke Bakken.

        * Improve unit tests:
        - increased timeouts for slow machines
        - eunit test bug fixes for hosts running a 32 bit os
        - bug fix for nif tests for when Google's protobuf library
          is not installed on the host

Version 3.26.1
2016-Sep-27

        * Don't generate auxiliary functions id/2, cons/3,
        lists_reverse/2, 'erlang_++'/3 if they are not used.
        Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for reporting.

Version 3.26.0
2016-Sep-21

        * New option {target_erlang_version,N}. Thanks to Eric
        Meadows-Jönsson for suggensting this.

        * New options defaults_for_omitted_optionals and
        type_defaults_for_omitted_optionals.  Also improved
        epb_compatibility when fields have [default=...] specified.
        Thanks to Luke Bakken for finding and analyzing this.

        * Fix for accessing bin/protoc-erl via symlinks. Thanks to
        Wang Chao.

        * Clarified licensing conditions. Thanks to Luke Bakken for
        proposing this.

        * Fixes for type-default handling for proto3.

        * Fixes for Erlang 19 (eunit and dialyzer)

Version 3.25.2
2016-Aug-25

        * New options: mapfields_as_maps, defs_as_maps and msgs_as_maps
        (-mapfields-as-maps, -defs-as-maps and -msgs-as-maps). Previously,
        these were all the same maps option, but now the maps option
        merely expands to the above.

Version 3.25.1
2016-Aug-24

        * New option, epb_functions, to control generation of epb
        compatibility functions encode/1, decode/2 etc. The
        epb_compatibility option now implies also epb_functions.

        * Fix for the by_proto sub-option to msg_name_prefix for map-type
        fields. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.

        * Add parsing of stream indicator to rpc service definitions.

        * Fix bug in fetch_rpc_def/2 for options maps (-maps) and
        defs_as_proplists (-pldefs).

Version 3.25.0
2016-Aug-16

        * Fix a crash for message name prefixing and suffixing or
        lower-casing for oneof, and also handle this for map<_,_> fields.
        Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.
        * Add an option, msg_name_to_snake_case, to turn SomeMsgName into
        some_msg_name. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.
        * Improve rebar3 compatibility. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.
        * Make it possible to specify msg name prefix on a per-proto-file
        basis using the by_proto sub-option. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.
        * Make the epb_compatibility option also imply the
        msg_name_to_lower option, and a "_pb" module_name_suffix option.
        * Add gpb_compile:string/2,3 to compile from a string
        * Add an option, import_fetcher to make it possible to specify
        an alternate source of imported files, instead of using the file
        system.
        * Add examples to the README

Version 3.24.4
2016-Aug-08

        * Proto3: Fix encoding of repeated fields of types string, bytes
        and sub messages. These were erroneously defaulted to packed.
        * Proto3: Fix parsing of unused fields: non-repeated message
        fields are optional, but were erroneously parsed as required,
        thanks to Tyler Margison for fixing.
        * A new Erlang Protobuffs option: epb_compatibility (-epb):
        If this option is specified, generate also functions encode/1,
        decode/1, encode_<MsgName>/1 and decode_<MsgName>/1.
        * Simplified interface for verifying translators for
        google.protobuf.Any messages: the '$errorf' is deprecated.

Version 3.24.3
2016-Jul-29

        * Decode unknown enums to integers. Integers are allowed for
        encoding, for symmetry. Thanks to Eric Meadows-Jönsson for
        suggesting.
        * Fix epb compat function when the .proto contained no
        messages, and the maps option was specified.
        * Fix a bad type spec for the generated encode_msg, to make
        dialyzer happier again about the generated code.

Version 3.24.2
2016-Jul-25

        * Fix parsing of rpc method options. Thanks to Tony Han for
        reporting.

Version 3.24.1
2016-Jul-25

        * In 3.24.0, the input encoding was effectively changed to UTF-8,
        whereas it previously was not defined, but in practice
        it was latin1. Now, both for backwards compatibility, and also
        for similarity with the behaviour of Google protobuf, treat the
        input format as UTF-8 if possible, and fallback to latin1.

Version 3.24.0
2016-Jul-23

        * Several improvements for compatibility with Erlang protobuffs,
        thanks to Luke Bakken for all of these:
        -- bool fields: Accept also 0 and 1 on encoding
        -- bytes fields: Accept also iolists on encoding
        -- API: Add compatibility functions encode/1 and decode/2
        * Accept an UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM). This is accepted by Google
        protobuf 3.0.0. Thanks to Julius Beckmann for highlighting this.
        * Related to the UTF-8 BOM, UTF-8-decode the input .proto files, and
        UTF-8-encode the generated files.

Version 3.23.2
2016-Jul-19

        * Bugfix compilation error with rebar on Erlang R16 and earlier.

Version 3.23.1
2016-Jul-19

        * It is now possible to pass user-data---via an option to the
        generated encode_msg, decode_msg, merge_msgs and verify_msg
        functions---to translators for google.protobuf.Any messages.
        * Type specs for strings now say iolist, because this is what they
        accept on encoding. On decoding, they always return strings or
        binaries depending on the strings_as_binary (-strbin) option.
        * Correct benchmark measurements.

Version 3.23.0
2016-Jul-12

        * Add possibility---the any_translate option---to specify a
        callback for translating (packing on encode and unpacking on
        decode) google.protobuf.Any types.

Version 3.22.5
2016-Jun-30

        * Bugfix a regression, which was introduced in 3.22.4, so that it
        is now again possible use integers for floating point fields, in
        the call to encode_msg. Thanks to Ilya Khaprov for spotting this.

Version 3.22.4
2016-Jun-30

        * For floats, handle infinity, and not a number.  They are
        represented as the atoms infinity, '-infinity' and nan.  Thanks to
        Ilya Khaprov for reporting this and hinting at a solution.

Version 3.22.3
2016-Jun-15

        * Running the eunit tests previously caused the files x.erl and
        x.hrl to be created as a side-effect, this has been fixed: they
        are no longer created.
        * Don't include the timestamp in a comment in the generated source
        code, for the purpose of reproducible builds.

Version 3.22.2
2016-Jun-04

        * For proto3, automatically find well-known types in imports,
        without the user explicitly having to specify include paths.
        This is done by adding an internal include path last.

Version 3.22.1
2016-Jun-03

        * Fix an bug in the generated code in Erlang 17. An attribute to
        mute dialyzer, for generated verifiers, wasn't available until
        Erlang 18, but erroneously used with too old Erlang versions.
        * Fix an bug in the generated code for fields of type
        map<KeyType,ValueType> for Erlang 17. A syntax that wasn't
        available until Erlang 18 was erroneously used already
        with Erlang 17.

Version 3.22.0
2016-Jun-03

        * Add proto3 support to a rudimentary level: support for the new
        syntax and semantics, but not yet any well-known types, or any
        JSON mapping.
        * Fix more dialyzer errors in the generated code.
        * For Erlang 19, use := for the type specs for maps for mandatory
        fields (required and repeated). For earlier Erlang versions,
        fallback to using the => notation.
        * Improve the error when an import file is not found, to make it
        easier to trouble-shoot search path problems.

Version 3.21.3
2016-May-30

        * Add support for extending messages in other packages.  As part
        of this, also fixup resolution of what 'extend' refers to.
        Thanks to Steven Gravell for reporting and providing code
        outlining the way to go.
        * Fix a bug if a message is 'extend'ed more than once.

Version 3.21.2
2016-May-27

        * Make it easier to HiPE compile benchmarks. Thanks to Luke
        Bakken.
        * Fix dialyzer error in the generated code, in verifiers for
        repeated fields, with the -Wunmatched_returns flag to dialyzer.
        Thanks to Luke Bakken for reporting this.

Version 3.21.1
2016-May-25

        * Improve performance slightly for maps by replacing calls to
        maps:find with map matching expressions. On the benchmarks, it
        only yields a 2-7% speedup, but the generated code looks nicer.
        * Refine the type definitions in gpb.hrl
        * Make dialyzer happy about gpb. (It is also happy about generated
        code.)
        * Several benchmark updates:
        -- Make it easier to run benchmarks for code generated with -maps.
        -- Update the benchmarks/README.txt, thanks to Luke Bakken.
        -- Use pkg-config if present to get protobuf lib information,
           thanks to Luke Bakken.
        -- Use which to find protoc command, else use PROTOC or PROTOHOME,
           thanks to Luke Bakken.
        -- Pass CXXFLAGS to C++ compiler so that include path to erl_nif.h
           can be specified, thanks to Luke Bakken.

Version 3.21.0
2016-May-17

        * Add support for map fields, ie fields of type
        map<KeyType,ValueType>. Only scalars (but not enums) and strings
        (not bytes) are allowed as keys. Any type, except maps, is
        allowed as value. Map fields are about to make it into Google
        protobuf 3.0.0, which as of this writing is still in beta. It
        appears it will be available in 3.0.0 for both proto2 and proto3
        syntaxes. (So far, gpb does not support proto3 at all.) Map fields
        have been tested with Google protobuf 3.0.0-beta2.
        The erlang-internal representation of a map<_,_> field is a list
        of 2-tuples---the order is undefined on decoding---or an Erlang map
        if the maps option is used.
        * Some option texts have been improved for the "protoc-erl --help"
        command.
        * With the maps option specified, the generated verifier now produces
        a more helpful error if any non-optional fields are missing from
        the map.
        * The descriptor proto has been updated (the -descr option).
        * The README has been updated.

Version 3.20.3
2016-May-04

        * Encode negative int32 values using 64 bits, for interop with
        other implementations. On decoding, assume either 32 or 64 bit
        encodings can appear. This is what Google's protobuf (C++) does.
        The same goes for negative enums. Thanks to YeJun Su for
        reporting.

Version 3.20.2
2016-Apr-08

        * Don't try to generate default values for maps. Thanks to
        Louis-Philippe Gauthier.
        * Accept the syntax="proto2"; statement, but so far only "proto2".
        Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for suggesting support of the
        syntax statement.

Version 3.20.1
2016-Mar-17

        * Bugfix the generated NIF code: if the .proto file specifies
        package, then any enums must be specified with namespace. Thanks
        to vesperusiak for reporting.

Version 3.20.0
2016-Mar-01

        * Add an option {erlc_compile_options,Str} (-erlc_compile_options Str)
        for inserting a -compile(Str) option into the generated code.
        Thanks to Guilherme Andrade.

Version 3.19.0
2016-Feb-04

        * Add an option msg_name_to_lower (Cmdline: -msgtolower) for
        changing all message name to lower case. Thanks to Roowe.

Version 3.18.10
2015-Nov-27

        * Fix bug with extend inside a message body. Thanks to Michael
        Ries.

Version 3.18.9
2015-Nov-17

        * Support extend inside a message body. Thanks to Michael Ries.

Version 3.18.8
2015-Jun-24

        * Fix another decoding/merging bug for maps with the option
        maps_unset_optional=omitted, this time for oneof with sub messages
        to be merged. This bug, too, was found with the quickcheck and
        gpb-eqc.

Version 3.18.7
2015-Jun-17

        * Fix typos in comments and texts. Thanks to Giacomo Olgeni for
        spotting and fixing many.

Version 3.18.6
2015-Jun-10

        * Implement support for maps in NIFs. As part of this, rework the
        eunit tests to run the NIFs in a separate erlang vm, for stability.

Version 3.18.5
2015-May-29

        * Fix a few decoding/merging bugs for maps with option
        maps_unset_optional set to omitted. The bugs were found with the
        help of quickcheck and the gpb-eqc.
        * The gpb_compile_descr module was forgotten in the gpb.app.src
        file, now it is included.

Version 3.18.4
2015-May-09

        * Include also the build in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
        Holschuh for finding it out.

Version 3.18.3
2015-May-08

        * Include the protoc-erl in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
        Holschuh for finding it out.

Version 3.18.2
2015-May-08

        * Bugfix the version tag in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
        Holschuh.
        * Bugfix decoding, for fields with optional submessages, for maps,
        generated with the option maps_unset_optional set to omitted.

Version 3.18.1
2015-Apr-29

        * Bugfix the helper/package-for-hex.pm about the file name change
        rebar.config -> rebar.config.script

Version 3.18.0
2015-Apr-29

        * Add an option, maps_unset_optional, for omitting optional
        values, for maps. With this option, there can now be an enumerator
        value that is 'undefined' without any confusion if it is
        optional. Thanks to Brett Bethke for prompting this to get
        implemented.
        * Test the generated code also for maps. This is ifdef-protected,
        so it still works with older Erlang versions, but maps are not
        tested then, of course. Due to this, the rebar.config has now
        turned into rebar.config.script.
        * Update the benchmarks to newer software versions and newer
        hardware.

Version 3.17.13
2015-Apr-16

        * Bugfix verification of strings with the strings_as_binary
        (-strbin) option. Thanks to Tilman Holschuh for fixing and to Luis
        Rascão for adding a test for it.

Version 3.17.12
2015-Mar-08

        * Bugfix exported types for CamelCase message names. Thanks to
        Louis-Philippe Gauthier for fixing and to Luis Rascão for adding a
        test for it.

Version 3.17.11
2015-Feb-23

        * When generating typespecs, generate types for messages, and
        export those types. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.10
2015-Feb-17

        * Fix Issues Building on Windows/Cygwin. Thanks to Brett Bethke.

Version 3.17.9
2015-Jan-30

        * When generating typespecs, generate types for enums, and export
        those types. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.8
2015-Jan-25

        * Add support for the enum "option allow_alias = true;" which
        allows more than one enum to have the same numerical value. Gpb
        will decode to the first defined enum symbol. Gpb no longer
        supports allow_alias = false. This option appeared in Google
        Protobuf version 2.5.0. Thanks to bb4242 for reporting.

Version 3.17.7
2015-Jan-07

        * Bugfix type specs for strings when using the strings_as_binaries
        option. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.6
2014-Dec-30

        * Bugfix NIF linking in eunit tests on Mac. Thanks to Luis
        Rascão.

Version 3.17.5
2014-Dec-15

        * Bugfix generated NIF code for with the -strbin option: the
        utf8_to_uint32 function was unused, as was (mostly) the
        utf8_count_codepoints. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
        reporting.

Version 3.17.4
2014-Dec-12

        * Bugfix generated NIF code for enums defined within
        messages. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for reporting and
        providing an initial solution.
        * Bugfix generated NIF code for strings with the -strbin (or
        strings_as_binaries) option. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
        reporting and providing a solution.


Version 3.17.3
2014-Dec-02

        * Bugfix parsing of files that specify a package, and import other
        files that also specify a(nother) package. Thanks to Wang Chao for
        asking the question prompting me to fix this.
        * Add a -pkgs command line option, for use_packages.

Version 3.17.2
2014-Nov-13

        * Rework the option parsing. No functional changes.
        * in helpers/git-hooks/pre-push, allow push of non-tagged
        non-master branches to github.

Version 3.17.1
2014-Oct-29

        * Bugfix decoding oneof when for sub messages, in the data-driven
        decoder in gpb. When the same oneof sub message appeared twice,
        the oneof field was overwritten instead of merged. This did not
        affect generated code. It only affected the gpb:decode_msg/3.

Version 3.17.0
2014-Oct-26

        * Support oneof fields. It appeared in protobuf 2.6.0, and is
        essentially several optional fields sharing the same record
        position (memory in the C++ alternative).
        * Make the name of the two records for fields and rpcs
        configurable. They ought to have been prefixed with gpb_ long ago,
        but that was not done. At least now, it is possible to redefine
        the record names, in case of clashes.
        * Handle services in descriptors.
        * Bugfix compilation for descriptors.
        * Add an option `warnings_as_errors' along with command line
        options -Werror, -Wall, -W1, -W0 and -W, that mimimcs the options
        to erlc. This also adds a new return value for failures: error.

Version 3.16.0
2014-Oct-13

        * When generating NIF code, also do the encoding in the
        NIF. Previously, the encoding was still done using plain Erlang,
        only decoding was in the NIF. Now the NIF does both encoding and
        decoding.
        * Fix potential memory leak when decoding, for odd/unusual error
        cases.

Version 3.15.0
2014-Oct-13

        * Specify that the NIF should run in a cpu-bound dirty scheduler
        when supported. This currently requires Erlang 17.3 built with
        --enable-dirty-schedulers. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
        asking the question, prompting me get it done.

Version 3.14.0
2014-Oct-01

        * In the Makefile, allow ERL and ERLC to be overridden via
        environment variables, thanks to Graham Crowe.
        * Avoid, and attempt to handle, unicode output in compilation
        errors in eunit tests.

Version 3.13.0
2014-Sep-17

        * New way to invoke the compiler: bin/protoc-erl. Thanks to Luis
        Rascão for the implementation.

Version 3.12.2
2014-Sep-16

        * Fix a race condition in the Makefile between all and doc
        * Elide falsely failing nif tests with 17 on 32 bits with an
        erlang vm compiled with gcc 4.9.0 or newer.

Version 3.12.1
2014-Aug-12

        * Update the README, with info on meta data for services. Thanks
        to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.12.0
2014-Aug-12

        * Add support for retrieving meta data for services. Rename
        gpb_compile:msg_defs/2,3 into gpb_compile:proto_defs/2,3, but
        retain the old function name and option names for backwards
        compatibility. Thanks to Luis Rascão for the implementation.

Version 3.11.0
2014-Jul-20

        * Add helpers for packaging to hex.pm. Thanks to Dylan Lukes and
        Paul Schoenfelder for prompting this.
        * Version numbers revisited, the version on github is now intended
        to always be reltools compliant, ie: to always consist of only
        integers and dots. Thanks to Volodymyr Kyrychenko
        for taking the initiative to this.

Version 3.10
2014-Jun-26

        * Bugfix verification of optional sub message fields, thanks to
        Klas Johansson.
        * Fix compilation warnings with Erlang/OTP 17.0
        * Improve/bugfix eunit tests in gpb_codegen_tests and
        gpb_compile_tests (compilation warning and nif include path issue,
        respectively)

Version 3.9
2014-Feb-04

        * Avoid single field map access---ie expressions on the form
        X#{key}---since neither the maps pre-release, nor the rc1 of R17
        supports it. Use matching to access such fields instead. This
        applies to records as well as maps. Performance is unaltered.

Version 3.8
2014-Feb-01

        * Bugfix generated code when there are no messages defined.
        Thanks to Graham Crowe for reporting.
        * Add possibility to suffix message/record and names and module
        names.

Version 3.7.1
2013-Dec-14

        * Bugfix a race condition in the Makefile. Thanks to Graham Crowe
        for fruitful discussions.
        * Rework the workaround for the bug in the syntax_tools in R16B03,
        so that the code that uses the parse transform need not change.
        Handle the odd case entirely in the parse transform.

Version 3.7
2013-Dec-13

        * Add a (GNU) Makefile, for projects that prefer to build this
        way. Thanks to Graham Crowe for suggestions and ideas.
        * Rework/fix the substitution in gpb_version.hrl.
        * Add support for Erlang/OTP R16B03, by working around a
        bug in syntax_tools (reversion of local implicit funs).
        * Change the months in this file, from numeric to 3-letters, to
        avoid ambiguities with different ways of writing dates in various
        parts of the world.

Version 3.6
2013-Nov-13

        * Add nif support for the strings_as_binaries (-strbin) option,
        thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for reporting this.
        * Add an is_binary guard to the top-level generated decode_msg/2
        function. Thanks to Klas Johansson for suggesting this.

Version 3.5
2013-Oct-27

        * Licence change: from LGPL 2 to LGPL 2.1

Version 3.4
2013-Oct-27

        * Licence modification/clarification: clarify that the licence (in
        the file COPYING.LIB) does not cover code generated with gpb.

Version 3.3
2013-Oct-27

        * Fix several errors in the gpb.app.src so that it works with
        Elixir and Relex, thanks to Paulo Almeida.
        * When decoding, reject messages with invalid varints.
        Invaid varints are encoded with too many bits. Previously,
        decoding a varint with very many bits (ie: with very many leading
        bytes > 128) would cause the Erlang VM to construct a very large
        number when decoding the varint. This would cause the Erlang VM to
        use excessive cpu resources and could eventually cause the Erlang
        VM to run out of memory. Now parsing fails immediately reading too
        many varint bits.
        * Fix a bug when generating code for maps.
        * Teach the benchmarks to do maps, and also improve
        various other benchmark related things.

Version 3.2
2013-Sep-16

        * Add preliminary support for maps, for generating code that
        encodes from and decodes to maps, as well as merges and verifies
        maps. The maps support is experimental.
        * Bugfix verification of integers: the wrong error reason could be
        generated for integers out of range.
        * Bugfix various dialyzer issues.

Version 3.1
2013-Sep-05

        * Bugfix compilation of several files (only the first file
        was actually compiled, even if several files were specified)
        * Add possibility to generate and encode a descriptor, which is a
        self-describing byte-blob according to descriptor.proto.
        * Add possibility to make the generated code compile-time
        independent of gpb by generating the introspection information to
        proplists instead of to #field{} records. The latter required
        including gpb.hrl at compiletime. (There's no run-time dependency)
        * Add possibility to prefix message/record and names and module
        names to avoid name collisions.
        * Add -type to the command line options, thanks to Louis-Philippe
        Gauthier. Previously it existed only as an Erlang API option.

Version 3.0
2013-Aug-24
        * Improve decoding performance by roughly 8--19%
        * Completely rewrite the code generator. Use a parse-transform
          instead of formatting and assembling strings.
        * Minor improvement in the generated code for version_as_list.

Version 2.3
2013-Aug-18
        * Fix Rebar compile on non-GNU systems, such as Mac OS X, thanks
        to Everton Ribeiro.
        * Bugfix (mostly) rare compilation breakage: depending on the
        date/time of generation, a new-line was inserted, causing a
        compilation error.
        * Ignore non-version-like tags

Version 2.2
2013-Jul-13

        * Wrap generated skip-functions with quotes. Thanks to jesse-ad.
        * Experimental support for calling protoc code via a NIF
        * Empty lists are now default values for repeated fields. Thanks
        to Martin Donath.
        * New option, use_packages for prepending the package name found
        in the proto file, to the message names. Thanks to Martin Donath.
        * New option: strings_as_binaries (-strbin), for returning strings
        as binaries. Thanks to Lars Thorsen for suggesting this option.
        * New option: {o_erl,Dir} (-o-erl Dir), {o_hrl,Dir} (-o-hrl Dir)
        and {o_nif_cc,Dir} (-o-nif-cc Dir) to specify destination
        directory by file type. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting
        those options.
        * New option: include_as_lib (-il) to include gpb.hrl as a
        library. This makes it easier to integrate with rebar. Thanks to
        Martin Donath.
        * Generate introspection functions for enum conversions:
        M:enum_symbol_by_value/2, M:enum_value_by_symbol/2,
        M:enum_symbol_by_value_<Enum>/1, M:enum_value_by_symbol_<Enum>/1;
        thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting those functions.
        * Bugfix name resolution. Thanks to Heiner Bunjes for reporting
        the bug. This prompted a major rewrite of the name resolution code
        that was originally a quick patch-work, and not in very good shape.
        * Handle C-style comments. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for reporting
        this bug.
        * Add a section to the README.md showing rebar integration, thanks
        to Bin Wang for asking the question that prompted me to write it
        up.
        * Bugfix command line option parsing using the -extra alternative.
        * Benchmark code improvements.
        * Build: version number: defined format and enforced/verified
        consistency between gpb_version.hrl and src/gpb.app.src: using the
        git tag as the source of information.

Version 2.1
2011-Oct-31  Tomas Abrahamsson  <tomas.abrahamsson@gmail.com>

        * Package names are dotted rather than with underscores
        * New generated introspection function: M:get_package_name/0.

Version 2.0
2011-Jul-10  Tomas Abrahamsson  <tab@lysator.liu.se>

        * First public version
