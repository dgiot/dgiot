Version 1.0.0beta (YYYY-MM-DD)

    - More robust message ID generation. Patch by Steve Cohen.

    - Fixed `make test` on OSX by replacing `cp -l` with `ln`. Patch by
      Johnlin.

    - Fixed handling of arrays of integers by Ruby's `encode_term` function.
      Patch by Johnlin.

    - Removed upper version limits for Python/Ruby. It seems Python versions up
      to 3.4.2 and Ruby up to 2.2.0 work without any other changes.

    - `make test` now uses Python/Ruby installed on the system.

    - More robust Python/Ruby version detection in case if ErlPort starts from
      another process. Patch by Maxim V.

    - Added Erlang R17 support for release and test scripts.
      Reported by Mark A. Sheldon. Patch by Alexander Shorin.

    - Added empty 'registered' option to erlport.app. This option can be needed
      by some external tools. Patch by Daniel Kempkens.

    - STDIN/STDOUT redirectors for Python in erlport.stdio modules now
      implements full file object interface. Reported by Francesco Mosconi.

    - Replaced proc_lib:spawn_link/1 with just spawn_link/1 because the former
      reports expected process exits as crashes if SASL is enabled. Reported by
      Sonic Gao.

    - Fixed too restrictive checks for PYTHONPATH and RUBYLIB paths. Reported
      by willemdj at GitHub.

    - Added rebar.config. Patch by Chad DePue.

    - Added Reference class and encoding/decoding for reference() Erlang type

    - Added Pid class and encoding/decoding for pid() Erlang type

    - Updated Atom representation

    - Fixed "Port._read_data() may read excess data"

    - Fixed a bug in the SMALL/LARGE_BIG_EXT decoding where an extra byte was
      being added to the number if there was any data after the number
      (Paul Bonser)

    - Added 'compressed' keyword argument for Port (Dmitry Vasiliev)

    - Encode None as atom none (Dmitry Vasiliev)

    - Encode dict as a proplist (ordered by Python sort order, may be used as
      orddict if keys are all the same type) (Bob Ippolito)

    - Encode True, False as true and false (Bob Ippolito)

    - Added support for encoding and decoding compressed terms (Bob Ippolito)
    
    - Optimized encoding and decoding of big integers, general encoder
      optimization hacks (avoid global lookups) (Bob Ippolito)

Version 0.4 (2010-01-10)

    - Added support for big integers

    - Added support for Erlang bitstrings whose length in bits is not a
      multiple of 8

    - Updated examples to work on Windows

    - Now decode() doesn't return String objects, only lists. Use String as
      wrapper if you expect Unicode string instead of a list.

    - Optimized encoding for lists of bytes (integer in the range 0-255)

    - Fixed encoding/decoding for integer values

    - Fixed encoding for small Unicode strings with characters in range 128-255

Version 0.3 (2010-01-03)

    - Added float datatype

    - Splitted Port and Protocol

    - Added more examples
