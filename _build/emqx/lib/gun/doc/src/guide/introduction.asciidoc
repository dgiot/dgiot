=== Versioning

Gun uses http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0].

=== Conventions

In the HTTP protocol, the method name is case sensitive. All standard
method names are uppercase.

Header names are case insensitive. Gun converts all the header names
to lowercase, and expects your application to provide lowercase header
names.

The same applies to any other case insensitive value.
